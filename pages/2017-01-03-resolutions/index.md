I've always been a big proponent of self-improvement, and the new year is a great time to re-evaluate your goals and do some good self-reflection. 

In my opinion, the key to new years resolutions is to think of some that **wont let you fail right away**. An example is a resolution of, "I want to read one book per month." (or something with a hard, measurable parameter). You might start off strong the first two months, but oops, on month 3 you picked a book that's too long and you couldn't finish it in time. Shit... you missed your goal! Now it's about 100x harder to continue working hard towards your goal since you already "failed". This is a bad resolution. Not because it isn't possible, but because of the hard parameter you can easily fail right away.

The solution to this is to either loosen up your parameter to say, 10 books in a year, **or** you can simply set your resolution as something like, "I want to read more books." This is something you can easily keep in the back of your mind, and the only parameter is **more**. This will prevent "failure" and keep your motivation up. 

My resolutions: 
 
* Read more!!
* Cook new things other than my usual go-to's
* Build wealth


Happy new year :)
