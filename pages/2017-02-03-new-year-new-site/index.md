It's a new year! And what better way to kick it off than with a new personal website. This time around, I'm using the lightning fast static site generator [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), which is built in react. I used to have my blog hosted on a completely different service, but Gatsby was exactly what I needed to put it all together in one place. Not only was I able to learn and hone my react/ES6 skills, I'm able to package my site into a nice, fast, static distribution.

I'm planning on adding many more features in the coming weeks, stay tuned :)
