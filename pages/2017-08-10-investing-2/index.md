Here's personal finance update #2. This time around I've been a bit more active on Robinhood by picking up some solid big name stocks, as well as some dividend growth ETFs. I've also added a new category, Coinbase, where I'm going to be slowly accumulating Bitcoin and Ethereum. My 401(k) took a nice jump due to employer matching date coming around. My savings is a bit low since, I'm focusing on paying off my credit card. Summer in Chicago can be _real_ expensive :P

Thats the update! I'm really excited to add cryptocurrencies to the mix. Bitcoin and Ethereum are all the rage right now, so I jumped on the bandwagon.
