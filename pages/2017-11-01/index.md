Here are some thing I've learned lately, in no particular order or category:

* Melatonin helps me sleep, but gives me vivid and disturbing dreams.
* I really enjoy working on the back-end, and I'm excited to get better at Python and Golang.
* NodeJS is far from the high-level language I percieved it as, it's actually far from it.
* Data encryption is facinating and insanely complicated.
* There is more to life than JavaScript.
* I love my job, but I hope they pay me more soon.
* Buy Bitcoin.
* It's never wrong to be honest about your feelings. Always be up-front about it
* Trust your gut, it's usually right even if your heart disagrees.
* Every penny you can contribute to your investments will make a difference.
* You'll never know where you can make a friend, always be open and kind to people around you.

It's been a transformative few weeks for me, and I feel good about it. Every day is something new, make sure your life gives you that.
