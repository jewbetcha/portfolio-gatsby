At the end of last year, I made a post [here](https://colemanrollins.io/blog/saving/) about a new plan for saving my money. I was going to get agressive with my investments and with my diversification. Now, six months later, I'm happy to say I've saved over $10k and have allocated over 90% of my liquidity to my investments. I feel as though I have compiled a nice mix of asset classes, to hopefully give myself a portfolio with nice growth. I don't _really_ know what I'm doing, but I have done a lot of research and have made low-risk decisions on what I want to do. My next step is to find someone I know to help me get an idea of how I'm doing, just to make sure I'm not headed straight for disaster.

Here is a snapshot of what I have going on. I'll give some details afterwards.
